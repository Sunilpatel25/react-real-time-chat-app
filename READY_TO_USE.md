# ✅ FIXED - Ready to Use!

## The Error is Fixed! 🎉

### What was wrong?
The backend endpoint `/api/users/make-admin` didn't exist, so the frontend was trying to parse an HTML error page as JSON.

### What did we fix?
1. ✅ Added the `/api/users/make-admin` endpoint to backend
2. ✅ Improved error handling in AdminSetup component
3. ✅ Restarted both servers to load changes
4. ✅ Added helpful error messages
