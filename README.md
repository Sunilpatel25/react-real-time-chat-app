# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run locally

These instructions assume you're on Windows using PowerShell (the provided shell on Windows). They cover starting the frontend (Vite) and the backend (Express + Socket.IO).

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

Quick start (two terminals)

1) Install dependencies for both frontend and backend

Open a PowerShell terminal in the project root and run:

```powershell
npm install
cd backend; npm install; cd ..
```

2) Create backend environment file

Copy the example and fill in your values (in PowerShell):

```powershell
cd backend
copy .env.example .env
# Then open .env in your editor and replace the placeholders (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET)
cd ..
```

3) Start the backend (in its own terminal)

```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev   # uses nodemon and will restart on changes
```

If you prefer the non-dev server:

```powershell
npm start
```

By default the backend listens on port 8900 (changeable via `PORT` in `backend/.env`).

4) Start the frontend (in a separate terminal)

From the project root:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Vite will print the local URL (usually http://localhost:5173). Open that in your browser.

Environment variables used by the backend
- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB connection string (required)
- `JWT_SECRET` - secret used to sign JSON Web Tokens (required)
- `PORT` - optional, defaults to 8900

Where to look for backend code
- `backend/server.js` - main server and Socket.IO setup
- `backend/routes/*` - API routes
- `backend/models/*` - Mongoose models

Troubleshooting
- If the backend exits with "MONGO_URI is not defined", ensure `backend/.env` exists and `MONGO_URI` is set.
- If you see MongoDB authentication errors, verify your connection string and network access (Atlas IP whitelist).
- If Socket.IO connections fail, check CORS settings and that frontend is using the correct backend URL/port.

That's it â€” let me know if you want a single-script npm task to start both servers concurrently, Docker files, or VS Code launch configurations.
